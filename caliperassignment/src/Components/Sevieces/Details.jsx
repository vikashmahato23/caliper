          <h2>What is a Hydroponic System?</h2>
          <p>
            New technologies are coming up every day in the world. As the world
            population is growing, the agriculture industry is also developing
            new techniques to grow food in lesser space and by saving water. The
            hydroponic growing system is a step towards this.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hydroponic System is a system of growing crops without soil, often
            called soilless farming. In the hydroponic system, the plant roots
            grow in a liquid nutrient solution or inside the moist inert
            materials like Rockwool and Vermiculite. The liquid nutrient
            solution is a mixture of essential plant nutrients in the water.
          </p>
          <p>
            The plant roots are suspended either in the static liquid solution
            or in a continuously flowing nutrient mixture. The hydroponic
            growing system requires continuous attention to the crops, unlike
            the traditional farming system.
          </p>
          <h3>Advantages of a hydroponic system</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Higher productivity than the traditional farming system, the plant
              nutrients are effectively used, and there is no wastage.
            </li>
            <li>
              The hydroponic system is a controlled climate system in which the
              crops can grow year-round.
            </li>
            <li>
              Water utilization is low when compared to the traditional farming
              method, up to 80-90 percent lower.
            </li>
            <li>
              The crops are grown in a closed space, which eliminates the attack
              of pests and insects.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Types of hydroponic system</h3>
          <p>
            The growing methods for each type of crop can be different so as the
            hydroponic system. When you are choosing between the various
            hydroponic systems, knowing about the basics of that system will
            help you in making the decision.
          </p>
          <p>Here is a quick go through some of the hydroponic systems:</p>
          <p style={style}>Standing Aerated Nutrient Solution: </p>
          <p>
            Nutrient Film Technique, gully channels are used in this system to
            grow plants, the nutrient solution keeps flowing in these gully
            channels. A pump connected to the reservoir pumps the nutrient
            solution to the NFT channels. One of the advantages of the NFT is
            the easy installation of the system and the relatively low cost of
            the materials.
          </p>
          There are two different types of NFT system:
          <ul style={{ listStyle: "number" }}>
            <li>Horizontal NFT System</li>
            <li>Vertical NFT System</li>
          </ul>
          <p style={style}>Aeroponic System:​</p>
          <p>
            Aeroponic System drastically reduces the amount of water used in
            growing crops. In this system, plant roots get their nutrients and
            water through the aerosol mist sprayed on them. Plant roots get the
            oxygen from the air while suspending. Aeroponic System is
            comparatively challenging to manage but much more economical in the
            use of nutrients and water.
          </p>
          <p style={style}>Dutch Bucket Grow System​</p>
          <p>
            As the name is depicting, this system uses buckets to grow plants.
            These buckets can vary in size, depending on the requirement of the
            grower. The bucket has a growing media like vermiculite to support
            the growing plant. ​ Plants having much larger roots are grown with
            the help of the Dutch Bucket system like tomato and cucumber.
          </p>

            How much does it cost to set up a Hydroponic farm in one Acre?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Adaptation of new technologies makes you feel more confident about
            yourself. When it comes to adapt those technologies in the farm
            business, people usually took their foot back. The reason behind
            this is not having precise information about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are thinking of setting up your dream hydroponic farm, we are
            here to assist you in your path of success. We will talk about those
            things here that take up a large part of your investment in the
            hydroponic farm.
          </p>
          <p style={style}>Land on which the hydroponic farm will set up: ​</p>
          <p>
            Choosing where to set up your hydroponic farm is crucial. The land
            should have proper access to electricity, water, and a nearby
            market.
          </p>
          <p>Outer Structure:</p>
          <p>
            The outer structure of the hydroponic farm provides a protected
            environment for the crops. There are two types of outer structure
            mainly, one is polyhouse type, and the other is the greenhouse type.
            Both the structure has distinct advantages.
          </p>
          <p style={style}>Growing System:</p>
          <p>
            The growing system depends on the type of plant you want to grow in
            your hydroponic farm. If you are planning to crops like lettuce,
            kale, the NFT system will be suitable, and if you need to grow
            vegetable crops like tomato and cucumber, the Dutch bucket system
            will be fit.
          </p>
          <p style={style}>Temperature and Irrigation Controlling System:</p>
          <p>
            The temperature controlling system will maintain an optimum
            temperature for the growth of crops. The irrigation system will
            irrigate or pumps the nutrient solution to the growing system and
            continuously monitors the moisture. ​
          </p>
          <p>
            The estimated cost of setting up a hydroponic farm in India in
            one-acre will come between Rs. 1.45 Cr to Rs. 1.80 Cr. It is an
            estimated cost and can vary according to your specific choice of
            equipment.
          </p>
          <p>
            A hydroponic farm of one-acre can produce around 90,000 to 95,000
            lettuce plants, that will ensure high profitability. For more
